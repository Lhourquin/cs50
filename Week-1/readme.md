# Week 1 - C

Machine only understand binary, where humans write *source code*, a list of instructions for the computer that is human readable, machine only understand what we can now call *machine code*. This machine code is pattern of ones and zeros that produces a desired effect. It turns out that we can convert *source code* into `machine code` using a very special piece of software called a *compiler*. We will be introducing you to a compiler that will allow you to convert source code into programming language *C* into machine code. In addtition to learining about how to code, we will be learning about how write good code. 
Code can be evaluated upon three axes:
* First: *correctness* refers to "does the code run as intended ?"
* Second: *design* refers to "how well is the code designed ?"
* Finally: *style* refers to "how aesthetically pleasing and consisten is the code ?"
